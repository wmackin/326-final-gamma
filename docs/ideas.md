# Innovative Idea

Our project will aim to create a platform where users can organize and share their thoughts on league of legends lore. We plan to source the stories from the main league of legends universe website. This platform will utilize a like system and a place where people can rank their stories from favorite to least favorite. We will also utilize a profile page, where users can see their own submissions and can work as a place to organize their thoughts on the lore. It will also track what pages each user has read so they can see a completion percentage and see what they haven’t read yet. Each page will have discussion and question sections to discuss a topic (likely in a Reddit thread style). Users can also upload fan fiction and get responses to it. Users can allow fill out some information about preferences in the game for social networking.

# Individual Components

A home page will have links to different types of lore, plus fan fiction, reviews left by the sign in user.

Clicking on a type of lore will show a list of pieces of lore of that type.

Each individual piece of lore will have a link to the official page for that lore, a place to leave a review, and a forum underneath, with a discussion section and question section.

A user page will show reviews left, and any fan fiction uploaded, plus a percentage of how much of the canon lore they’ve read. A user can click on this to see which pages they have and haven’t read.

On profile creation, a user will be surveyed about some League of Legends questions to be added to their profile.
