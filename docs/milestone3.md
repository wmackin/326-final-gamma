# Describing data implementation

As for the functionality of our app data, we created a database from a JSON file containing a list of objects that contain the useful data we need. For the regions, we stored data including the region name, a link towards the regions official website, and the official image of the given region. For the champions, we stored data including the champions name, a link towards the champions official website, the official image of the given champion and the region the given champion is from.
